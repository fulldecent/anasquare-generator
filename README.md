Getting the Words
=================

The word dictionary is NOT included in this repository, you will need to find or
make your own.

`    alias shuf=gshuf`

\>\> Pick X words you like, each having X letters, or choose randomly:

`    shuf Dictionary/6.txt | head -n6`

\>\> Find another set of words with these same letters:

`    ./findanagram.pl cereal waffle coffee muffin butter pepper <
Dictionary/6.txt`

Making the Puzzle
=================

\>\> Run the solver

`    ./compose 6`

\>\> If multiple solutions are found, add a letter to your puzzle to
disambiguate, then try again

`    echo -e "hello\nnasty" | perl -e
'$a=<>;$b=<>;$a=~s/[^a-z]//g;$b=~s/[^a-z]//g;$l=length($a);$c="."x$l;for($d=0;substr($a,$d,1)
eq substr($b,$d,1);$d++){};substr($c,$d,1)=substr($a,$d,1);print $c;'`

\>\> If unique solution is found you are done
